### A Python library to interact with Active Collab data

At (udox)[http://www.u-dox.com/] we use Active Collab to manage our projects
and act as an issue tracker across departments. This library allows you to
execute commands with a given API key and get back readable data so you can
interact with it via code or just keep tabs via the command line easily.
